//[]The guesses will end once the user guesses a correct answer or they run out of attempts.
//[] Display all the possible correct answers to the user- use loop
//[] Final score at end of quiz 
//[] Use console.logs throughout the code to track the questions that are being asked to the user, and add addtional CSS to style your HTML page.

// Stretch Goals
// []Attempt to make your code more DRY by putting all of the questions, answers, and responses to the first five yes/no questions into arrays (or even one huge multidimensional array), and modifying the game logic such that a ‘for’ loop will control the flow from question to question.
//[]Make the number-guessing question use a random number as its correct answer.
